## Installation
This project works with both gulp and polymer cli. I recommend using the gulp build as it has vulcanize and various other optimizations built into it. To install, run:

```
npm i -g bower && vulcanize && gulp
```

Install dependencies by running:
```
bower install && npm install
```
## To run polymer locally

To serve up the polymer app locally run:

```
npm run start
```

Alternative, if you'd rather use polymer-cli, run:

```
polymer serve
```
